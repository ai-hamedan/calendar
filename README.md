# calendar
Calendar is my third project which uses sqlite3 to store tasks and events.
As you can see in the following picture, each category of events have different colors and for adding an event you should complete title, category, detail of the event, By adding an event in the event lists, it is added simultaneously to sqlite3 database.

you can also add tasks to the program and to save it in database, save changes button should be clicked.
